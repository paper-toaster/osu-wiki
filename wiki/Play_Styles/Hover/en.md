# Hover

Hovering is a term used to describe the act of navigating (or "aiming") a [tablet](/wiki/Glossary#tablet) pen across a tablet by holding the pen above the surface of the tablet while still inside of the active hover zone. Thus you are "hovering" the pen above the tablet. This is a method of pen navigation in opposition to [dragging](/wiki/Play_Styles/Drag). It can be found across players of all skill levels, although it is most often associated with highly skilled players.

*Note: though players may argue, there is no one play style/input method that is objectively better than the other; most everything is down to personal preference at the end of the day.*

Arguments in-favor of hovering often claim that it reduces/removes the need to buy replacement nibs, removes the need for a tablet cover, and is (technically) "faster" due to a lack of friction. Whereas arguments against hovering often claim that it is much more difficult to accurately stop or turn on [jumps](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern/Jump) and right angles.

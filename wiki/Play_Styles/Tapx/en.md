# Tapx

*Notice: this play style requires the use of a [graphics tablet](/wiki/Glossary#tablet) (digitizer).*

**Tapx** is a tapping style for [tablet-only](/wiki/Play_Styles#tablet-tap-(or-tablet-only)) players in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) in which players click circles, slide sliders, and spin spinners by tapping a tablet pen onto a tablet, along with a secondary keyboard and/or tablet key to assist with [streams](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern/Stream) and [stacks](/wiki/Mapping_Techniques/Stack). This method is fairly difficult for most players and is not very popular amongst most tablet players.

Streaming via tapx is performed by alternating between tapping a pen onto a tablet and pressing one other assigned secondary key (`Z` and `X` by default) rapidly. Some players may find comfort in alternating between a tablet tap and the secondary key between every [hit object](/wiki/Hit_Objects) similar to the way players who [alternate](/wiki/Play_Styles/Alternating) determine key presses between each hit object.

*Note: the input overlay will show all tablet taps as `M1`

Tapx is less of a personal preference/advantageous tapping style, and more of a necessity to tablet-only players as it is widely recognized that streaming using only tablet taps is practically impossible.

*Notice: even though players will argue, there is no one tapping style that is better than the other: it's all down to personal preference.*

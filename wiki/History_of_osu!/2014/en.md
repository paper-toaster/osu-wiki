# History of osu! 2014

## January

The entire [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_points) system was completely disabled for maintenance on 20 January 2014 due to miscalculations that had occurred over the previous few months \[1\]. This disabling was then followed by an announcment on 26 January 2014 that detailed a complete, from-the-ground-up redesign of the pp system that was set live the next day \[2,3\]. The new system was designed and implemented by [Tom94](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1857058) and had aimed to base pp scores off of a new "difficulty value" (separate from [star rating](/wiki/Beatmapping/Star_rating)) that was determined for every [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) and [mod](/wiki/Game_modifier) combination in the game \[1\]. As a result of this, the old pp system was renamed to "ppv1" and the new system was named "ppv2".

## March

On 1 March 2014 the performance points system redesign by Tom94 in months prior was ready to be set live for [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) as the official ranking system for those modes, along with a reminder that the current system was not yet 100% finished, and futher feedback from players was still needed \[4\].

As [skinning](/wiki/Skinning) elements expanded, the element, `playfield.jpg` was deprecated and replaced with a new generic one that is not modifiable. `playfield.jpg` was an element that allowed skinners to use any image as the default background of a beatmap if one was not supplied. This functionality was later brought in the form of `menu-background.jpg`, which change both the main screen and default playfield backgrounds \[5,6\]. <!--date needed-->

## April

The first ever "osu! Monthly Fanart Contest" was announced on 3 April 2014. The contest was an informal contest run by [LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1079) that would run monthly and award two winners one year of [osu!supporter](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) (one picked by public and the other by osu! staff) \[7\]. The first contest was concluded in a [newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2014-05-21-first-official-osu-fanart-contest-results) on 21 May 2014 with players [kunny](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3931585) and [DumplingYumYum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715930) winning first and second place respectively \[8\].

## June

On 18 June 2014, [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) announced that the download limitations would be removed for all users; however, there was still a, quote, "sanity limit" that would prevent bots from downloading too much \[9\]. <!--more information needed-->

## October

As always, many new things were added to osu!. One being the new sign-in screen. Another being the new system for scrolling in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania). It was to be based off of the beatmap's bpm rather than a fixed scroll! New intro and outro sequence and an awesome theme song were added into osu!, rather than a random beatmap's music to be played. And many discovered that osu! was pronounced as \\oss!\\, not \\osU!\\.

Lastly, leading to peppy making a tough decision to release *osu!test.exe* (now *osu!cuttingedge*) for **anyone**. This was to allow non-osu!supporters to *debug* osu! where the newest (or latest) builds of osu! would be updated to any client. That was, if they're wanting to use it's unstable/experimental features. Every function was given in osu!cuttingedge **except** for multiplayer (osu!supporter was required).

## December

"Merry Christmas" as peppy wrote with an update that had snow (current game mode icon) falling in the main screen!

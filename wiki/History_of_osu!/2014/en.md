# History of osu! 2014

## January

The entire [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_points) system was completely disabled for maintenance on 20 January 2014 due to miscalculations that had occurred over the previous few months \[1\]. This disabling was then followed by an announcment on 26 January 2014 that detailed a complete, from-the-ground-up redesign of the pp system that was set live the next day \[2,3\]. The new system was designed and implemented by [Tom94](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1857058) and had aimed to base pp scores off of a new "difficulty value" (separate from [star rating](/wiki/Beatmapping/Star_rating)) that was determined for every [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) and [mod](/wiki/Game_modifier) combination in the game \[1\]. As a result of this, the old pp system was renamed to "ppv1" and the new system was named "ppv2".

## March

As skinning elements expanded, the element, `playfield.jpg` was removed in it's line of duty and replaced with a new generic one that is unskinnable. `playfield.jpg` was an element that allowed you to use any image as the default background of a beatmap, if one isn't supplied.

## October

As always, many new things were added to osu!. One being the new sign-in screen. Another being the new system for scrolling in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania). It was to be based off of the beatmap's bpm rather than a fixed scroll! New intro and outro sequence and an awesome theme song were added into osu!, rather than a random beatmap's music to be played. And many discovered that osu! was pronounced as \\oss!\\, not \\osU!\\.

Lastly, leading to peppy making a tough decision to release *osu!test.exe* (now *osu!cuttingedge*) for **anyone**. This was to allow non-osu!supporters to *debug* osu! where the newest (or latest) builds of osu! would be updated to any client. That was, if they're wanting to use it's unstable/experimental features. Every function was given in osu!cuttingedge **except** for multiplayer (osu!supporter was required).

## December

"Merry Christmas" as peppy wrote with an update that had snow (current game mode icon) falling in the main screen!

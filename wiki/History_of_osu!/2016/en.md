# History of osu! 2016

## January

The ability to see live previews of a selected skin in the options menu was re-added to osu! on 28 January 2016 after having been removed for two years. The feature was initially removed in 2014 due to an options menu refresh in 2014 [[1,2]][r].

## February

On 13 Febuary 2016, controversy had sparked from changes in the BAT (Beatmap Appreciation Team) and a new rule proposal that attempted to change the then-current beatmapset spread in Ranked beatmaps [[3,4,5]][r]. <!-- DO NOT oversimplify here. I'm gonna leave this to start writing later-->

Two new items were added to the osu!store in Febuary: the osu!mug, and the osu!go. The former being a typical coffee mug with the choice of either an osu! logo or a chibi pippi on it; the latter was a custom-designed USB stick that was preloaded with the osu! client, capable of playing osu! directly off of the USB stick [[6]][r]. <!--price missing; dates missing-->

## March

On the very first day of March, Ephemeral created the first in a series of posts on [peppy's blog](https://blog.ppy.sh "ppy blog") that would become the "Meeting Notes", which served as an attempt to provide more transparency between the osu! team and the community. In these posts, Ephemeral would summarize the main objectives, ideas, and thoughts that the team had towards the future into digestible bullet points. The main thoughts and objectives described in this first post were primarily geared towards improving the team and their communication across the board (with emphasis mapping and modding) [[7]][r].

The osu!hoodie and osu!buttons were added to the store for the first time during the third week of March [[8]][r].

## April

The modding panel on the new osu! website was set live for public testing on 11 April 2016; however, public testing was only available for [Ice - L2 - Ascension : Act 2 (Liberation) (LordRaika)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/123760) and [Camellia - overcomplexification (ProfessionalBox)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/351408). According to [Loctav](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/71366), the main idea of the panel was to make every user post every isue individually and discuss it individually, as part of the steps towards implementing the long awaited Modding V2.

## May

The first osu! remix contest begins with the challenge of remixing nekodex's "circles!". From Polygon, Keiichi Yano, one of the leading minds behind games like Elite Beat Agents, has given praise towards osu! for its community that wants to share beatmaps they create. [Aspire](/wiki/Aspire) returns due to overwhelming demand.

## September

[osu!mania 4k World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments/MWC/2016_4K) concluded with South Korea being victorious against Brazil. peppy tweeted regarding the 9th anniversary of osu!; however, stated that there nothing was planned for this year. The osu!taiko mascot voting results were in, peppy reminds that the community picked winner was *not* the new mascot since the osu!team wanted to take more into account than the mascots' loliciousness. [yuki.](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/4), a brand new osu!musician, entered the stage with a new community mapping contest.

## October

osu! World Cup 2016 registrations opened. GML applications were opened for those who wish to join. The [loved](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#loved) beatmap status was introduced in its testing stage as a way to give community-loved, but unrankable, beatmaps leaderboards. Those types of beatmaps will, however, not award [pp](/wiki/Performance_Points) and their leaderboards could be deleted for when the creator updates their beatmap. The Halloween-themed 7th fanart contest opened. Loved was in its second testing state, ready for a new batch of beatmaps to enter this category. A new video featuring osu!lazer was released. Most notably, the hit circles had more textures to them and gave off a smooth and shiny look. osu!idol 2016 voting were opened. A few days before Halloween, the Halloween fanart contest was opened and concluded two days later. The osu!weekly released the 78th issue on Halloween, making it as spooky as possible (but where did the 77th issue go? We'll never know).

# History of osu! 2015

## February

Storyboard rules were updated to allow for image sizes larger than 854x640 on 16 February 2015. As  suggested by [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661), the new maximum rankable image size in storyboards was updated to 1366x768 \[1,2\].

## March

Ther first ever edition of osu!weekly was released on 13 March 2015, written by [Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958), positioning itself as "a weekly news digest covering the latest happenings of the game and its community" \[2\].

The first ever osu! Beatmap Blueprint stickers were added to the [osu!store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/listing) on 20 March 2015. The stickers came in two packs of 8.5" x 11" custom sitcker sheets featuring elements such hit circles, combo counters, sliders, and much more \[3\]. In celebration of the launch, a contest was also run to see who could make the best [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) using the stickers, with a first place prize of an osu! tablet and osu! sticker sets 1 and 2. Despite this, no actual follow-up towards this contest was ever publicly announced, thus it is presumed that the contest was cancelled \[3,4\]. <!--official verification needed; price needed; discontinue date needed-->

[Wii Remote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote "Wikipedia") support was added for [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) on 26 March 2015 \[5\]. <!--changelog entry missing-->

[osu!coins](/wiki/osu!coin) were a joke in-game currency addded to osu! by [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) on 31 March 2015 as part of an April Fools' day joke. The coins were made to parody [free-to-play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play "Wikipedia") mobile games' common use of in-game currencies and [microtransactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction "Wikipedia") and were quickly removed the next day.

## April

Some small, miscellaneous changes were made during April: the `#balkan` channel was re-added to the game as per a [feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/152009&start=0) on 2 April 2015 \[6,7\], the [Co-op mod](/wiki/Game_modifier/Co-op) became an unranked mod on 6 April 2015 \[8\], and 9K was made rankable after being given proper use support in the editor on 30 April 2015 \[9\].

## May

*Notice: The [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/334994) that announced news of the new ranking system was released on 4 June 2015, although the old system was actually fully deprecated on 1 May 2015, and full implementation of the new system was still yet to be available to the public by the end of 2015.*

The old Beatmap Nominator (BN) ranking was fully deprecated on 1 May 2015, and replaced with a new, real-time ranking. This new ranking retained the original goal of the previous one, although it focused on challenge and collaboration as opposed to individual performance over a set timeframe. Public reception towards this new change was overall mostly positive, although many users did remark that the new system was confusing \[10,11\].

The [osu!news YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZKQIqv9O2tddMNUMAxWaqQ "YouTube") uploaded its [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQbudVxEjr8 "YouTube") to the public on 8 May 2015. The channel was run by various members of the community and aimed to create videos on skin showcases, tournaments, mapping, contests, and other news from the community [12,13]

## July

peppy and flyte briefly explained why the temporary osu!web redesign subdomain was `jizz.ppy.sh` in an episode of osu!talk.

<!-- I won't be mentioning anything about osu!next development in these articles (2015 specifically as thats when a lot of stuff was being "leaked" to the public), as lazer could—and should—have its own entire article dedicated to it. This also goes for Cutting Edge as well, as both lazer and Cutting Edge could have entire systems implemented, only to be reversed the very next day; nothing is concrete-->

# History of osu! 2015

## February

Storyboard rules were updated to allow for image sizes larger than 854x640 on 16 February 2015. As  suggested by [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/98661), the new maximum rankable image size in storyboards was updated to 1366x768 [[1,2]][r].

## March

Ther first ever edition of osu!weekly was released on 13 March 2015, written by [Tasha](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1031958), positioning itself as "a weekly news digest covering the latest happenings of the game and its community" [[2]][r].

The first ever osu! Beatmap Blueprint stickers were added to the [osu!store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/listing) on 20 March 2015. The stickers came in two packs of 8.5" x 11" custom sitcker sheets featuring elements such hit circles, combo counters, sliders, and much more [[3]][r]. In celebration of the launch, a contest was run to see who could make the best [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) using the stickers, with a first place prize of an osu! tablet and osu! sticker sets 1 and 2. Despite this, no actual follow-up towards this contest was ever publicly announced, thus it is presumed that the contest was cancelled [[3,4]][r]. <!--official verification needed; price needed; discontinue date needed-->

[Wii Remote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote "Wikipedia") support was added for [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko) on 26 March 2015 [[5]][r]. <!--changelog entry missing-->

On 31 March 2015, [osu!coins](/wiki/osu!coin) were added as a joke in-game currency for osu! as part of an April Fools' day joke. The coins were made to parody [free-to-play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play "Wikipedia") mobile games' common use of in-game currencies and [microtransactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction "Wikipedia") and were quickly removed the next day.

## April

The `#balkan` channel was re-added to the game as per a [feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/152009&start=0) on 2 April 2015 [[6,7]][r].

The [Co-op mod](/wiki/Game_modifier/Co-op) became an unranked mod on 6 April 2015 [[8]][r].

9K was made rankable after being given proper use support in the editor on 30 April 2015 [[9]][r].

## May

*Notice: The [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/334994) that announced news of the new ranking system was released on 4 June 2015, although the old system was actually fully deprecated on 1 May 2015, and full implementation of the new system was still yet to be available to the public by the end of 2015.*

The old Beatmap Nominator (BN) ranking was fully deprecated on 1 May 2015, and replaced with a new, real-time ranking. This new ranking retained the original goal of the previous one, although it focused on challenge and collaboration as opposed to individual performance over a set timeframe. Public reception towards this new change was overall mostly positive, although many users did remark that the new system was confusing [[10,11]][r].

Among the changes and announcemnts made surrounding beatmap ranking, [a change was made in the ranking process](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/325973) on 5 May 2015 that allowed players to dipsute disqualifications made by the Quality Assurance Team (QAT), due to the lack of any way to dispute issues that the QAT may bring up. The new change made it from then on possible to submit a form if there was a dispute, where a final decision could be made regarding the map and whether it is ready to be ranked [[12]][r].

The [osu!news YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZKQIqv9O2tddMNUMAxWaqQ "YouTube") uploaded its [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQbudVxEjr8 "YouTube") to the public on 8 May 2015. The channel was run by various members of the community and aimed to create videos on skin showcases, tournaments, mapping, contests, and other news from the community [[12,13]][r].

The osu!keyboard (also known as the "osu! 'nono' keyboard") was added to the osu!store on 30 May 2015, retailing for about $40 at launch. Initially announced in a [tweet by peppy](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/603797988742336512) on 28 May 2015, there were only 100 keyboards available at launch, and were more akin to modern-day osu! keypads than a full-sized keyboard [[14,15]][r].

## June

Implementation of the username change system in the osu!store was set live on 16 June 2015, although full functionality of the system was not available until 18 June 2015. The changes made it so that players must pay $4 USD for their first name change, $8 USD for their second, $16 USD for their third, doubling the price each time with a cap at $100 USD; however, if a user has bought an [osu!supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support), then their first change is free [[16,17,18,19]][r].

The ability to see what a replay would look like without mods was added on 23 June 2015 as per a [feature request](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/97560), although the change only made the mods [Double Time](/wiki/Game_modifier/Double_Time), [Half Time](/wiki/Game_modifier/Half_Time), and [Flashlight](/wiki/Game_modifier/Flashlight) toggle-able [[20]][r].

## August

The Chat Moderators were officially merged into the Global Moderation Team (GMT) on 20 August 2015 [[21,22]][r].

## September

The old FPS counter was replaced with a new "refresh and latency display" on 2 September 2015. This new display would still display the current FPS (frames per second), but the new change caused it to hide from view if it exceeded 500 FPS. In addition, a new counter was added below the FPS counter that would display exactly how much latency was being intrtoduced frame rendering (measured in milliseconds). "Stuttered" or "dropped" frames would be shown as coloured rectangles to the left of the counter to better visualise excactly how much frame render latency a user was experiencing [[23,24]][r].

On 26 September 2015, [cYsmix](http://cysmix.com/ "cysmix.com") became one of the first official osu! artists. This partnership entailed the creation of four  along with the creation of a mapping contest using those tracks. The aforementioned four tracks are as followunique tracks made specifically for osu!:

- ["Manic"](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-manic-osu)
- ["House with Legs"](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-house-with-legs-osu)
- ["Dovregubben's Hall (New Ver.)"](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-dovregubbens-hall-new-ver-osu)

Each track had its own pre-timed `.osz` file included with it and were released on [cYsmix's SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie "SoundCloud") on 28 September 2015.

In addition to this, an "open bounty" (more commonly known as "Mapping With Rewards") was created for this event, that allowed anyone to map one of the aforementioned tracks, get it into a rankable state, and if it was "amazingly awesome" enough, that person would recieve a bounty of it. The bounty reward offered at the time was as follows: one song bundled with client (for a limited period of time), $50 osu!store credit, 6 months supporter tag, and a unique profile badge. This open bounty was reportedly created due to a want for rewarding players for quality beatmaps and to celebrate the new tracks but without having to go through the hassle that comes with running traditional mapping contests [[23]][r].

Despite [promises from peppy on his blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/132009865043/mapping-with-rewards-oct-2015 "ppy blog"), however, the results for Mapping With Rewards were not posted by the end of the year.

<!--I don't think we should be mentioning anything about future years in the history posts as I want to make the posts as seamless as possible so that we only have to update the current (previous) year and not go back and fix anything, thus im not mentioning any future competitions, nor am I mentining the results of the competition, as they were announced in 2016-->

## October

After many months of work, a full migration form [DirectX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX "Wikipedia") to [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL "Wikipedia") graphics rendering was completed and pushed out to all users on the Stable release stream on 16 October 2015. Users who were not able to run the new update due to compatibility issues, however, were switched to a new release stream named "Stable (Fallback)", which used the old DirectX graphics rendering.

<!-- I won't be mentioning anything about osu!next development in these articles (2015 specifically as thats when a lot of stuff was being "leaked" to the public), as lazer could—and should—have its own entire article dedicated to it. This also goes for Cutting Edge as well, as both lazer and Cutting Edge could have entire systems implemented, only to be reversed the very next day; nothing is concrete-->

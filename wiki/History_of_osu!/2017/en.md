# History of osu! 2017

## February

**The first public osu!lazer pre-release build was released on 12 February 2017** [[1]][r].

## March

**Beatmap Spotlights were formally introduced to the public on 18 March 2017** [[2,3]][r]. First mentioned in a [developer meeting post on peppy's blog](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/149588555393/2016-08-dev-meeting "ppy blog"), Spotlights intended to fully replace the Ranking Charts that had been in place for so long, by following a system split into two "rubrics" described in its [announcement newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-03-18-introducing-to-you-spotlights):

> - Spotlights: Similar to the previous Charts, this is where the most noteworthy maps of each month will be showcased, awarding the #1 placed mapper with 1 month of supporter. These maps will be included in the Beatmap Pack Listing.
>
> - Themed Spotlights: Released in a bi-monthly manner, at the end of these months players will be able to compete on themed compilations, such as "Electronic" or "Summer", awarding the #1 placed player with 1 month of supporter. Additionally, by completing a whole themed pack you will gain achievements.

**On 9 May 2017 it was announced that osu! would attend [Anime Expo](https://lite.anime-expo.org/ "Anime Exop") 2017 as part of their 10th anniversary celebration** [[]][r].

The general plan was to have a free-play set up of around eight computers to run tournaments for each day of the event. In addition to this, several panels would be run that would go further into the hisotry of osu!, along with an open Q&A session with various team and community members.

The event ran from 1–4 July 2017 at Los Angeles Convention Center, and was remarked as being quite successful by those involved <!--left off here-->

## June

The osu!team participates in Anime Expo for the upcoming 10 years of osu!. On 2017-06-15, the main menu/playfield image has been changed to four generic, but new, images. The playfield image changes when the current song is changed. Support for enabling or disabling the seasonal backgrounds all year round or sometimes seeing them has been added to the [Options](/wiki/Options). Somewhere around this month, inside the osu!dev Discord, the osu!weekly was discussed to have been dead. From this point forward, each official and community news post will be posted independently when it is ready, rather than waiting every week. The Mocha in Summer fanart contest began.

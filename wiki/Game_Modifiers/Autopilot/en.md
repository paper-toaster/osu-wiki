## Description

*Notice: enabling the Autopilot mod will cause the play to be unranked and will not be saved to the local leaderboards.*

The **Autopilot** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) for [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) that will take control of the cursor movement and systematically move to the exact centre of the next [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object), leaving the tapping to to the player. During a play with the Autopilot mod enabled, the player will not be able to move their cursor, unless they are on the pause screen.

The Auto Pilot mod also hides the [score](/wiki/Score), [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo), and misses, as well as makes it impossible to fail the [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps).

Additionally, the spins per minute (SPM) value performed by the Autopilot mod is similar to the spins per minute performed by the [Spun Out](/wiki/Game_Modifiers/Spun_Out) mod, thus the player cannot increase the SPM by spinning the spinner with their cursor.

## Description

*Notice: enabling the Co-op mod will result in an unranked play.*

The **Co-op** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) for [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) that introduces a secondplayfield with a second set of controls based on the current *x*K count (7K -> 7K + 7K = 14K). For osu!mania-specific [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps), the *x*K is split to half (7K -> 4K + 3K = 7K).

![Co-op gameplay comparison](/img/GM_COOP.jpg "Comparisons between a normal play (top-left) vs. a co-op play (top-right) of an osu!mania-specific beatmaps, and a normal play (bottom-left) vs. a co-op play (bottom-right) of an non–osu!mania-specific beatmap")

The following table only affects beatmaps converted from [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes) to osu!mania with the Co-op mod on:

| Default | 1K | 2K | 3K | 4K | 5K | 6K | 7K | 8K | 9K |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 4K | 0.82x | 1.00x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x |
| 5K | 0.78x | 0.86x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x |
| 6K | 0.74x | 0.82x | 1.00x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x | 0.90x |

*Note: The Co-op mod gives no penalty on osu!mania-specific beatmaps.**

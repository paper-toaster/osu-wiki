## Description

*Notice: enabling the Relax mod will cause the play to be unranked and will not be saved to the local leaderboards.*

The **Relax** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) that aims to allow a relaxing experience to players. Due to its nature, the mod is typically utilised to analyze/practice difficult [patterns](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern) on [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps), or for when players want to give their tapping hands a rest.

<!-- ### Trivia -->

<!-- placeholder -->

## osu!standard

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), enabling the Relax mod only requires ther player to hover their cursor over [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object); all hit objects will be automatically tapped by osu!. 

The Relax mod also hides the [score](/wiki/Score), [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo), and misses and makes it impossible to fail a beatmap. Additionally, the spins per minute (SPM or RPM) value will be doubled, allowing the player to spin much faster and thus obtain a higher score than would in a regualr play.

## osu!taiko

In [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), the Relax mod removes colour judgement: the correct colour for the note is hit regardless of the colour given. Although the colours of the notes will not be changed.

Along with this, the Relax mod will also give more lenient timing to collect the slider ticks during drumrolls, while dendens can be cleared with any colour sequence instead of alternating the colour sequence. The animated mascot will also be removed. 

Unlike osu!standard, in osu!taiko, the Relax mod *will* display score, combo, and misses.

## osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), the Relax mod allows the character to be moved freely at any speed with the mouse or other cursor-moving peripheral.

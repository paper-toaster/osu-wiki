# No mod (term)

*For the full list of all mods, see: [Game Modifiers](/wiki/Game_Modifiers)*

*See also: [Free mod](/wiki/Game_Modifiers/Free_mod)*

## About

- Abbreviation: NM
- Alternative spellings: `NoMod`, `No-mod`, `Normal Mod`

## Description

**No mod** (NM) is a term used to describe a play that does not use any [Game Modifiers](/wiki/Game_Modifiers). The term is most commonly used in [tournaments](<!---->) to distinguish certain categories or restrictions. But "No Mod" is also used to distinguish certain "types" of players or plays.

## Use

### Tournaments

<!--PLACEHOLDER-->

### Regular players

"No mod" is also very common term amongst regular players. For example, a player who typically enjoys playing with no game modifiers enabled, and has many of their top plays use no mods, they would typically be called a "no mod player" (similar to calling a player a "DT player"). While in other instances, some other players may use the term to say that they are "good at no mod" as a way to say that they typically obtain better scores without the use of mods. <!-- < line is kinda verbose -->

# Game modifiers

*Not to be confused with [modding](/wiki/Modding)*

<!-- image here -->

**Game modifiers** (or "mod" for short) are optional modifications to a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps)'s elements and settings that players can enable from the `Mod Selection Screen` (above). Mods can make beatmaps easier, harder, or just plain fun.

Players can access the `Mod Selection Screen` in the song selection screen by clicking the `Mods` button near the lower left corner of the screen or by pressing `F1` on their keyboard. Once i the `Mod Selection Screen`, there are also keyboard shortcuts that can be used to select specific mods. These shortcuts may be changed in the Options.

On the selection screen, mods are seperated into three categories: `Difficulty Reduction`, `Difficulty Increase`, and `Special`, and they can either reduce, increase, or remove the `Score Multiplier`. When two mods are being used simultaneously, the mods' respective multiplier will be multiplied together (e.g., `1.06x` * `1.12x` = `1.1872x`).

<!-- Score Multiplier really needs it's own stub. -->

## Trivia

- osu! used to round down the Score Multiplier to the nearest hundredth until a patch<!-- in (year)--> fixed the rounding problem by only rounding up if the thousandths value is 0.005 or higher.
- Some (if not, most) players argue that the Easy mod fails to make beatmaps easier to play. Many claim that the circles become comically large and that the low [AR](/wiki/Beatmapping/Approach_rate) makes the beatmap nearly impossible to read. This is most prevalent on more difficult beatmaps.
  - These points are elaborated upon in the "[Let's talk Easy Mod](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/56606)" feature request to improve the mod, by Lybydose.
- When playing with Sudden Death mod enabled in osu!standard mode, there are rare cases where the player may survives from a full life bar drain for breaking the combo count. If the player managed to preserve at least a sliver of health by getting a slider tick in a very short time-margin right after the combo broke and before the life bar is drained completely, the player can continue playing the beatmap as is and no large miss figure will be imposed.
  - Since the slider tick health gain must be sufficient enough to outlast the natural health drain over time, it may be impossible to continue at higher difficulty settings even when the player survives the full life bar drain.
- Nightcore originated from an [April Fools joke](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/49733).
- Flashlight mod was subjected to heavy controversy regarding the implementation in 2010 for being the easiest mod to hack on forced the mod to be unranked until a patch was implemented to cover the Flashlight implementation loophole. Further information regarding this incident can be found at the two threads below.
  - [Flashlight is back!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41519)
  - [Flashlight mod disabled #2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41039) <!-- I'm not entirely sure what to do for these two links -->
- By using the Co-op mod, it is entirely possible to increase the key count in osu!mania to 18 Keys (9K mod -> 9K + 9K = 18K). Though this is only applied to non-specific difficulties.

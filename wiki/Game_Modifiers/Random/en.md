The **Random** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) for [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) that aims to give players an interesting and fun experience for osu!mania by randomizing the note placement. The Random mod will not change the length of the notes, and it is not shuffled every time Random is used.

## Description

*Notice: enabling the Auto mod will cause the play to be unranked and will not be saved to the local leaderboards.*

The **Auto** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifier) that allows players to watch a perfect playthrough of the selected beatmap. 

The mod functions exactly like a [replay](/wiki/Replay), with the options for 0.5x/1.0x/2.0x speed playback to be used and comments on the beatmap to be seen and made like normal. The Auto mod will always get an SS grade, with the exception of a few special cases.

### osu!standard

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), when encountered with a spinner, the Auto mod will spin to a maximum of 477 spins per minute (SPM) in a counter-clockwise rotation.

### osu!taiko

In [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), the Auto mod will attempt a perfect playthrough, but won't always get an SS grade. It will occasionally miss a tick on drumrolls that do not start on a whole or half beat and will not always be able to complete dendens on maps with a very high overall difficulty.

### osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), the Auto mod will actually go beyon perfect and use unlimited speed to catch *every single banana* in a spinner, despite such a feat being impossible for a human player. 

### osu!mania

In [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania), the Auto mod will attempt a perfect playthrough, but may miss densely-stacked notes (e.g., multiple key presses close together on a hold bar).

## Trivia

- When watching an Auto replay, the username displayed in the leaderboard will be "osu!."

## Description

*Note: the method used to increased the speed does not increase the pitch of the song.*

The **Double Time** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) that attempts to increase the difficulty of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) by increasing their overall speed (BPM) by 150% (1.5x), reducing the length of the song by 33%, and increasing the [approach rate (AR)](/wiki/Beatmapping/Approach_rate), [overall difficulty (OD)](/wiki/Beatmapping/Overall_difficulty), and [health (HP)](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health).

The Double Time mod is widely regarded as one of the best mods used for gaining large amounts of [performance points](/wiki/Performance_points) on eaiser difficulties in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!).

### osu!taiko

In [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), the hit leniency is greatly reduced when the Double Time mod is enabled due to osu!taikos already strict overall difficulty along with its considerbaly more difficulty-to-hit slider ticks. Because of this, the Double Time mod is widely regarded as the hardest mod in osu!taiko and is seldom used.

### osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), there is no overall difficulty to increase. Thus this mod only increases the BPM and AR. As a result, it is only worth a 1.06x multiplier (as apoosed to 1.12x multiplier for every other mod.

Although this mod does greatly increase the hyperdash leniency, making fruits require hyperdashes that are near impossible to catch in some cases.

## Trivia

- When the Double Time mod is enabled, the `Length`, `BPM`, and `Objects` values are colored in a light red with the new values. (Pictured below.)
  - The `Objects` value is colored a light red even though no change in value is actually made.
- The `CS`, `AR`, and `HP` values will have a superscript triangle next to their values indicate a small increase in their values. (Pictured below.)
- The name "Double Time" could be labeled as a misnomer, as the DT mod does not actually increase the speed of a beatmap by two times (200%); it speeds up beatmaps by 1.5x (150%).

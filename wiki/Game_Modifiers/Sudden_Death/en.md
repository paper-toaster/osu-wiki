## Description

The **Sudden Death** mod is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) that causes players to fail a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) upon missing a [hit object](/wiki/Hit_Objects) or failing to collect a slider tick. This is useful for players who are going for an [full combo (FC)](/wiki/Glossary#fc). Although there is some debate as to whether the use of the Sudden Death mod or the act of retrying at the first [combo break](/wiki/Glossary#combobreak) is helpul or harmful for players wanting to improve quickly,

To be more specific, the Sudden Death mod will only fail the beatmap if any of the following happen:

- Missing a note
- Failing to collect a slider tick (osu!standard only)
- Failing to complete a spinner

The Sudden Death mod **will not** fail the beatmap if any of the following happen:

- Missing a [sliderend](/wiki/Hit_object/Slidertail) (i.e. a sliderbreak)
- Not holding/collecting on the enmpty slider path

Unlike the Sudden Death mod's variant [Perfect](/wiki/Game_Modifiers/Perfect), the beatmap will not automatically retry the map. Instead, the player will be left with a normal failure screen upon missing.

This mod has the same effect across all [game modes](/wiki/Game_Modes).

### Trivia

- Missing a note with the Sudden Death mod enabled will result in an extra large miss figure to appear in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!)

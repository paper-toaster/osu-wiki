# Score Multiplier

*See also: [Game Modifiers](/wiki/Game_Modifiers)*

## Description

The **Score Multiplier** is a value used to determine how much osu! should multiply the [score](/wiki/Score) recieved from each individual [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object) throughout a play. By default, the Score Multiplier will be 1.00x, but this value can be changed through the use of [game modifiers](/wiki/Game_Modifiers).

For example, if a player plays a map with no mods enabled, and gains a final score of 100,000, then the final score will be 100,000. But if that same player achieved the *exact same play* on the *exact same [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps)*, with the [Hard Rock](/wiki/Game_Modifiers/Hard_Rock) mod enabled, then the final score would be <!----> because the Hard Rock mod's Score Multiplier value is <!---->x. The formula below describes how the values are multiplied.

However, if multiple mods are enabled, the Score Multiplier value is calculated by multiplying the respective values of the two mods to get the final Score Multiplier value. For example, if the Hard Rock mod and [Half Time](/wiki/Game_Modifiers/Half_Time) mod are enabled, the final value will be <!---->x. (Calculated as <!--PLACEHOLDER-->)

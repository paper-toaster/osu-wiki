# Test mode

The **test mode** is a feature of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). The mode is intended to allow creators to play their own [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) quickly and easily within the beatmap editor for testing purposes. The mode can be accessed via the `Test` button near the bottom-right corner of the editor.

Playing a beatmap in test mode differs from that of playing it normally in that it will not submit any scores, does not display any leaderboards, will not let users fail the beatmap, and will display the following information on the left-hand side of the screen:

- The current timestamp of the beatmap.
- The SB load.
- The total amount of 300s, 100s, 50s, and misses gained.
- The percentage of hits that are mistimed hits
- The average delay (in milliseconds) that mistimed hits are late.
- The beatmap's [star rating](/wiki/Beatmapping/Star_rating).
- The total play length of the beatmap (in seconds).
- The maximum possible combo any one player could achieve on said beatmap.
- Various shortcut controls.

Test mode requires users to save their beatmaps before playing, and can cause some lag or framerate drops for some users. Additionally, test mode also allows users to watch the beatmap in "autoplay," which plays the beatmap for said user just as the [Auto](/wiki/Game_modifier/Auto) mod would.

# ppv1

The **first performance score** (abbreviated as **ppv1**) was an ancient ranking system for players globally across all modes in osu!. It replaced the old system of *ranking by total score* and was abandoned due to the implementation of [ppv2](..).

## History

ppv1 was launched in April 2012 and was initially mentioned in players' profiles under the name ``???`` during a test phase before finally being renamed to **pp** (performance points) on April 17, 2012. This system existed with the previous ranking system (*ranking by total score*) and eventually became the unique system in-place on July 24, 2012 during the release of the version [20120722-24](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/posts/1687719 "20120722-24") of the osu! client.


This system was initially updated at regular intervals, usually every 24 hours, to finally run in real-time on 16. August 2012.

ppv1 was abandoned and replaced by **ppv2** on 27 January 2014.
The reasons behind that change were the criticism of the players:

* Missing opacity of the algorithm
* Promotion of ``Hard`` difficulties with mods
* Low worth of insane difficulties

It also allowed peppy to seperate the job of maintaining and updating the filing system to and thus ease its workload.

## Algorithm

The calculations involved are not publicly known, however some indications on the inner workings of the system were disclosed:

- ppv1 highlights the skill and can not be farmed.
- The score is evaluated in relation to the difficulty of the map, based on statistics that were not available to the public.
- The number of points obtainable naturally decreases with time (thus, inactive players may loose up to half of his points within a year).
- No penalties for bad scores, only rewards for good scores.
- All *ranked* and *approved* maps are taken into account in the calculations.
- The accuracy is taken into account.
- The multipliers of mods are different from those announced in the game.
- Mode specific difficulties are favored.
- If a score is not placed in the top 500 of a map, it will not count.

## Climbing the rankings

The ranking is mainly related to the performance on individual maps, resulting in players to only focussing and mastering single difficulties.

- Playing better and scoring better grades on the beatmaps.
- Making sure to get some very good scores rather than thousands of mediocre scores.
- Improving the accuracy. Even a small percent can make the difference.
- Getting a rank on the most popular maps, where it is harder to get a place.
- Playing difficult maps.
- Improving old scores.
- Geting SS grades.

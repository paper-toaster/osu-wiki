# TAG

**TAG** is a term used to describe a type of [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) that is designed for more than one person to play at the same time in [multiplayer](/wiki/multi) mode, using the [Tag Coop or Tag Team Vs](/wiki/Multi#tag-coop-/-tag-team-vs) mode.

In these modes, each player is responsible for one [comboset](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo), and throughout the song both players switch who plays between each comboset. Because of this, TAG maps are designed in such a way that their combosets are mapped much farther apart than usual, making it nearly impossible to play by a single player.

TAG difficulties are usually denoted by the use of the term "TAG" in the beatmap difficulty name. Most often "TAG" will be followed by a number, which typically denotes how many players the beatmap is meant for (e.g., "TAG2 for two players, TAG4 for four players, etc.).

Due to their nature, TAG difficulties are always unranked because they are intentionally designed to be near impossible for a single player, although this has not stopped users from trying.

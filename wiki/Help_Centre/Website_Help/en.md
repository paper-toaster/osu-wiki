## I haven't received a reply to my support ticket, and it's been over 2 weeks!

**The vast majority of the time, this is due to a high number of tickets coming into our system at once.**

You can always send a single reply to your currently open ticket asking about the state of your case, but make sure not to do this more than once or twice a week. You can also contact us on Twitter at [@osusupport](https://twitter.com/osusupport) to ask about your ticket.

In rare circumstances, support tickets from chronically offending users may be deliberately ignored. Although the team will **always** tell you when they'll no longer be responding to you. If you haven't received a notification like this, you don't need to worry about it!

## My user page contents are missing!

**This can happen if your user page had inappropriate content on it, as defined by our [Community Rules](/wiki/Rules).**

In such cases, you may open up a ticket with the support team by emailing [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) and discussing your situation with them.

If at any point you are in doubt as to whether or not something is appropriate for a userpage, you can message any of the members of the [Global Moderation Team](/wiki/People/Global_Moderation_Team) with what you plan to put up, and they will let you know if it is okay.

## Can I completely block another user from contacting me?

**Yes, absolutely!**

In the event that another user is harassing you via private messages either on the forums or via the game client itself, there are a few steps that you can take to filter out their messages.

### Blocking a user from contacting you in-game

**To block a user from sending you messages in-game, simply add them to your ignore list.**

1. Go to `Options` (or press `Ctrl` + `O`).
2. Type "ignore" to filter the options listing to the "Chat Ignore List" section.
3. Add the offending user's username to the list, separating each new user with a space, and replacing any spaces in their name with underscores. (E.g., a user called `The Gatekeeper` would be typed as `The_Gatekeeper`).
4. You're done!

After doing this, you'll no longer see public chat messages from any users on that list, nor will you receive private messages from them.

If you want to ignore highlights, private messages, or public messages, in specific, you can simply append respectively `@h`, `@p`, `@c` to their username. For example, `The_Gatekeeper@c` will ignore the user's messages in public channels. It's possible to combine these as well: `The_Gatekeeper@ph` will ignore highlights and private messages, but leave public messages visible.

### Blocking all non-friends from sending you private messages in-game

If you wish to prevent anyone not on your friends list from sending you private messages, do the following:

*Notice: moderators are not affected by this functionality and can always privately message you. If you feel a moderator is harassing you in spite of this, you should contact [our support team](mailto:support@ppy.sh) immediately.*

1. Click the `Options` menu button in-game (or press `Ctrl` + `O`).
2. Type "block" to filter the options listing to the "In-game Chat" section.
3. Toggle the setting on by clicking `Block private messages from non-friends`.
4. You're done! Users who aren't on your friends list can no longer contact you.

### Blocking public forum posts from a user <!-- TODO: this part needs to be rewritten for the current website, "foes" is no longer available on the old one -->

*Notice: the Foes list is currently unavailable on the new website.*

**To naturally hide most public forum posts from a particular user, add them to your Foes list via the UCP.**

1. Head over to the [foes list setting in the UCP](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=zebra&mode=foes) and simply add their username to the list as pictured.
2. Click submit.
3. You are done! Most forum posts from that user will no longer be visible to you; it will be as if they were never there. Other users quoting their posts will still be visible, though.

### Prevent any new forum private messages from reaching you

Go to your [account settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit) and click `block private messages from people not on your friends list` in the Privacy section. Private messages from users in your friends list will still reach you.

### What if I'm still having problems with a user after blocking them?

**Never fear, for our support staff is here!**

If a user is still harassing you via other means, or using their friends or someone else to circumvent your effort to block them, please send us an email at [support@ppy.sh](mailto:support@ppy.sh).

Make sure to include any chatlogs or other evidence in the email, and our support staff will look into your case and see it sorted for you.

## What are these "user pages" that I see on other players profiles?

**User pages are special profile elements that all players with a [supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) get access to. They can contain whatever you like: pictures of your achievements, your beatmaps, basically anything you wish!**

Players with a supporter tag are given the privilege of editing their very own page to display on their profile! User pages may contain anything you like, so long as it follows the [Community Rules](/wiki/Rules)!

Even if your supporter tag happens to run out, your user page will **still remain visible** and you'll still be able to edit its contents.

## Do I need to use my email address to register?

**Yes. We require your email address to send you password reset requests and verification codes when needed.**

If you have trouble connecting via the game client, please check your firewall and anti-virus settings to make sure osu! isn't being blocked.

If you ever lose your password or cannot access your account, your registration email is our first point of contact with you.

## Why are the statistics in my user profile page wrong?

**You might be looking at your stats for another game mode! The website defaults to showing your scores for the mode you last played.**

If you've been inactive for a long time, and your statistics are shown wrong, simply play a few maps to display them again. Inactive users may have their scores hidden to keep the rankings fresh.

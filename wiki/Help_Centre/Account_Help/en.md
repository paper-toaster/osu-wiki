## Supporter

### I've paid for a supporter tag, but still haven't received it!

**Depending on what payment service you used (PayPal or Xsolla), there may be a slight delay in the processing of your payment before it reaches us.**

Usually these issues resolve themselves within a few hours, and our systems will automatically apply the tag to your account.

If it's been over 24 hours and you still don't have your supporter tag, please email [support@ppy.sh](mailto:support@ppy.sh) and let us know about your problem.

Make sure to include any receipts that you received during the process (PayPal transaction IDs, Xsolla receipts, etc), as these help us a great deal in tracking down what happened to your payment!

## Restriction

### What does it mean to have a "restricted" account, exactly?

**A person with a restricted account is temporarily or permanently prevented from interacting with the community in any meaningful way. Including chatting, participating in multiplayer, and having their scores on leaderboards.**

If your account has been restricted, you'll likely know why after a brief conversation with the support team.

In situations where we are *absolutely assured* that foul play or wrongdoing has taken place, we will ask you to wait out a period of **three months** from the date of your last offense before we consider an appeal from you to let you back into the game.

Please refer to *[Account Restrictions](/wiki/Help_Centre/Account_Restrictions)* for more information on account restrictions and the appeal process.

## Sign in

### I forgot my username and password!

**Please use [the password recovery page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/password-reset) to reclaim your account automatically, provided that you still have access to the email you originally registered with.**

If this does not work for you (or you do not have access to your registration email), please send an email to our [support team](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) with as much information as you can think of to help us acknowledge you as the owner of your account.

When sending an email, please include the following information:

- The name of the email address that you registered the account on (or any other email the account has been associated with since)
- Any receipts for purchased osu!supporter tags or other items from the osu!store
- The last date you can remember being able to access your account normally
- Any other identifying information that you think could be helpful (excluding scores or replays as those do not help us very much!)

### My account has been stolen!

**Try using [the password recovery page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/password-reset) to see if your account's email is still valid.**

If this succeeds, you'll be able to reset your own password without the assistance of the support staff.

If this does not work for you, please send us a support ticket as soon as possible to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) with as much identifying information as you can gather in order to help us establish you as the owner of your account.

*Notice: Please do not include replay or score data in your ticket as we cannot use this to verify your ownership of the account.*

Emailing from your registration address is a huge bonus here, as well as any other information you can provide that only the holder of the account would know. Including the following information will help us out immensely:

- The name of the email address that you registered the account on (or any other email the account has been associated with since)
- Any receipts for purchased osu!supporter tags or other items from the osu!store
- The last date you can remember being able to access your account normally
- Any other identifying information that you think could be helpful

### The website is telling me that I've tried to sign in too many times!

**This is a temporary protection measure after repeated failures to access your account.**

If this happens to you, simply wait for awhile and try to sign in after 10â€“20 minutes.

A couple of hours at the absolute maximum will clear the status for most people and allow them to sign in again.

### I didn't receive any emails from osu!/I forgot my email address!

**Please keep in-mind that there may be an issue with your account's current email address.**

If you remember your account's attached email address, try visiting the Email section in the [account settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit) page to change your email address. Fill out the necessary fields and click `Update` when you're done.

If you lost your account's password and are not receiving any password recovery emails, or you really just can't remember what email address you were using, please contact us at [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh). Any information you have about your account (e.g., your username, any screenshots that show you signed in to the client, past transactions through the store or supporter payments, etc.) will be helpful!

It's also important to remember that some providers don't accept automated emails from us. If you are using any of the providers listed below, please contact us by physical mail and we'll change your email address for you:

- `att.net`
- `bellsouth.net`
- `free.fr`
- `i.ua`
- `laposte.net`
- `sbcglobal.net`
- `t-online.de`

## Name changes

### Can I change my account's username?

**Yes, absolutely!**

If you've purchased (or been gifted) a [supporter tag](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support) at any point, you'll be able to change your username **once** for free. This name change can be redeemed at the [osu!store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/32).

At any point thereafter, you'll be able to purchase a name change to change your username to whatever you wish. However, each change will become progressively more expensive: the second will cost $8 USD, the third $16 USD, and so on up to a cap of $100 USD. We do this to prevent people from abusing the system to change their names in rapid succession.

Please note that usernames must abide by our [Community Rules](/wiki/Rules) in that they must not be broadly offensive to other users, overly provocative or otherwise inflammatory in any way. In addition, usernames that impersonate or assume the identity of major public figures (e.g., celebrities, politicians, etc.) are not allowed and will be forcefully reverted once we find out about them.

If you're only after minor capitalization or grammar/spelling changes, you can email [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) to request a free name change to fix these issues. We won't charge you for these sorts of name changes, but you **MUST** do them through a support email. We only perform this a limited number of times, so make sure you really want it!

### Can I take another player's username?

**Yes, but only under certain circumstances.**

If a player has not signed in for at least 6 months and has no plays, their username may be reclaimed (taken) via the [osu!store player name change page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/32) for a standard fee associated with username changes. <!-- what happens to the other player's username tho? -->

If that player *does* have any plays across any of the 4 game modes, a [non-linear function](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b89siyv9j8 "Desmos graph") is used to calculate how much extra time is added to those 6 months. This is to prevent people from stealing the usernames of active or recently retired players.

### Is it possible to change my name back or revert to my old username?

**Yes, but only under certain circumstances.**

We grant free reverts for a user's direct previous username. Simply contact [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) and request that your name change be reverted.

Changes to any other previous names must be [purchased via the osu!store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/32).

We only grant this one time per account, so please consider carefully before requesting!

### My username has been changed back/reverted!

**We only force username reverts for usernames that we deem inappropriate and/or abusive.**

If you find that your recent name change has been undone, it may be because the username you changed to was abusive, inappropriate, and/or considered offensive. We will not perform the change again, even if requested. But if you purchased it on the osu!store, we will offer a free name change to replace it. <!-- Does the player have to request this free name change replacement through an email? This line makes it unclear. -->

If the change was done with the free change that comes with a supporter tag, we cannot offer to change it again.

### Can I remove my previous usernames/delete my username history?

**Yes, but only under certain circumstances.**

Your profile will show all of your previous purchased name changes, but we only selectively remove the ones that may be an issue for you. If one of your previous usernames breaches your privacy (for example, if it contains your legal name) or can lead to your privacy being breached (via other websites), contact [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) to request that it be removed.

## Other issues

### The flag on my account's profile is wrong!

**We can change this for you, but only if you are actively living in the country that you wish to change to.**

We determine your country as shown on your profile page from the area in which you first registered your account from.

For example, if you create an account while on holiday in the United States, your account will show as belonging to the US and will appear on the country rankings for the US too.

The support team can and will happily change your account's country upon request, **but only if you are actively living within that country at the time.**

To confirm this, the team will ask for proof of residency, be it the appropriate passport, drivers license for your country, or some other form of ID. This must be displayed in a picture next to your monitor with the osu! client open and signed in to your account.

We will never display this information to anyone else, and we encourage you to blank out any personal information (that will not otherwise make it impossible for us to determine what country the document is for) if you are concerned about your privacy.

### Can I make more than one account?

**Unfortunately, no, you cannot.**

If we were to allow everybody to make and play on multiple accounts, the ranked scoreboards would be nearly worthless!

Other games encounter this issue a lot with what is commonly known as "smurfs," which are accounts with low playtimes and totals that inflate the rankings and prevent other users from playing competitively.

In osu!, we are very much against users having multiple accounts, and we enforce a strict rule of only **one account, per person, forever.**

You get to play on the first account you ever registered with us, and that's it!

### Is it possible to start over or have my account's statistics wiped?

**Not at the moment.**

We are considering extra "score reset" purchases from the osu!store for the truly hardcore players who wish nothing but perfection in their stats, but as it currently stands, we can't wipe an account's statistics for you.

This doesn't mean that you can make a new account to do the same thing, either! Having multiple accounts is strongly frowned upon (and against the rules) in our community and we will disable any such accounts.

### Can I play on a computer that another osu! user has used before?

**Yes, absolutely! This includes shared PCs like netcafes or PC bangs.**

Just so long as you are playing on only *your own account*. You can play osu! anywhere, you just have to sign in.

If you are playing from a public place, make sure to keep a close eye on your account security as shared computers are often prime targets for malicious software.

### Can I get a list of all the maps I've ever played or downloaded?

**You can see all the maps you've played on the website.**

**If you have an active supporter tag**, you can see all maps you have submitted a score on by going to the Beatmap section, then clicking the "Ranked (played)" filter. Alternatively, you can use [this link](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist?m=-1&r=7&g=0&la=0&ra=) to access the filtered page directly.

On the new website, this filter can be found by clicking "more search options" on the [beatmap list page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) then "Played" in the "PLAYED" section. Alternatively, you can use [this link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?played=played) to access the filtered page directly.

Unfortunately, we do not keep track of all maps a user has downloaded, so it is impossible to get a definitive list of them. The closest you could get to it would be using the aforementioned filter to recover at least the maps you've played before.

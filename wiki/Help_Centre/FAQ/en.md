## Alternative Game Modes

### What's this Taiko/Catch/Mania thing I keep hearing about?

**Taiko, Mania, and Catch the Beat are game modes available to play in osu!.**

osu! actually has 4 separate [game modes](/wiki/Game_Modes): [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania)! All 4 are based off of different types of rhythm games and they canbe accessed via the `Mode` button in the song selection screen.

![Mode change interface](/wiki/shared/Interface_mode.png "Mode toolbox in Song Selection (Solo)")

Click on the `Mode` button to open up a list of game modes available on osu!. Then, click on your desired game mode, and osu! will switch to that gameplay mode style, along with a relevant leaderboard change. Alternatively, you can use a shortcut to select a game mode by pressing `Ctrl` + the corresponding number. osu!standard uses the `1` key, osu!taiko use `2`, osu!catch uses `3`, and osu!mania uses `4`.

### What is osu!taiko? <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

*Full explanation: [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko)*

![osu!taiko Interface](/wiki/shared/Interface_taiko.jpg "In-game interface of osu!taiko")

*[Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin)* is a taiko drum rhythm game made by *Namco* (now Namco Bandai). The game involves the simulation of playing the taiko drum to the beat of the music. In osu!, beatmaps can be played in the styling of *Taiko no Tatsujin* through the use of osu!taiko game mode.

#### Basic explanation <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

##### Playfield <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Taiko playfield](/wiki/shared/Taiko_playfield.jpg "In-game playfield interface of osu!taiko")

For players with prior *Taiko no Tatsujin* experience:

- No chibi dancers at the bottom (must be storyboarded)
- The health bar must be at least 50% full to pass the song (which is not really obvious using the default skin; please look in the [Skin Compendium](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/686664) for a decent osu!taiko skin)
- *Kiai Time* triggers the *"Go-Go Time"*
  - Gameplay gimmicks like the hit balloons or forked paths are not implemented (only the barebone basics)
- Background display difference
  - osu!taiko-specific beatmap usually has its own custom background, leaving upper section empty
  - A video or static background image-only beatmap will take the lower portion only
  - If there is an element of storyboard, it will take over all the available screen space except the gameplay-important parts

For newcomers of osu!taiko mode, the screen is split to two different sections; the upper section contains the gameplay elements while the lower section contains an image or video for the beatmap. At the upper section, there is the health bar, which unlike other game modes, starts off empty and must be filled up to at least 50% full or half-full to pass the difficulty. At the top-middle part below the health bar, a taiko drum is located at the left-side and a moving conveyor belt which carries the hit objects from right to left passing through a double white circles which serves as judgement circle near the taiko drum. Above the taiko drum is the animated taiko mascot which will react based on judgement received along with upper background colour changes. Lastly, there is the usual score, accuracy, and timer of the beatmap at the upper-right.

Please note that health drain is disabled in osu!taiko, so only the hit objects will affect the health bar. Combo will not break when playing on an empty field. Unlike osu!, the combo milestone celebration is every 50 consecutive hits. The base score will be boosted after obtaining a combo that is a multiple of 10, but stops at 100 (max combo limit for the boost). If the combo is broken, the boost resets back to the base score. During *Kiai Time*, every successful hit will give the player 20% more points over the current score amount. Score gained from a hit can be checked below the accuracy at the upper-right corner in red.

##### Taiko notes <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Taiko hit circles](/wiki/shared/Taiko_hitcircles.jpg "osu!taiko notes of various colour and size")

Each taiko notes (or notes, for brevity) will appear as either a red or a pale-blue circle. Those coloured circles were named Don (red notes) and Katu (blue notes), respectively.

If it is a small red note, press the button bound to the inner portion of the taiko drum or hit the large flat area (center) of the *TaTaCon*. If it is a small blue note, press the button bound to the outer ring of the taiko drum or hit the sides of the *TaTaCon*. If the note is a **LARGE** circle, press or hit both of either inner or outer drum depending on the colour of the note for double point (a single correct hit will give single point instead).

The notes must be pressed or hit in the small white judgement circle next to the drum. Hitting the wrong colour, or both red and blue colours at the same time, will be considered a miss.

##### Drumrolls <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Taiko drumroll](/wiki/shared/Taiko_drumroll.jpg "osu!taiko drumroll")

Hit the inner (or outer) drum continuously for points until the end of the drumroll. For **LARGE** note, hit both buttons on the inner (or outer) drum simultaneously and continuously until it is done. Do note that drumrolls hits were hardcapped and only counted when hitting on the tiny hit circles, rather than drumrolling as fast as possible as in *Taiko no Tatsujin*.

Drumrolls can be ignored with no health penalty, as it does not recover the health bar at all. However, it will cost possible points gained from the drumroll. Each successful hit on the tiny hit circle gives a static 300 score.

##### Dendens <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Taiko spinner](/wiki/shared/Taiko_spinner.jpg "osu!taiko spinner (denden)")

Hit the inner and outer drum **in order** (like red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, ...) until the denden counter reached 0. Starting colour does not matter (allowed to start with blue if desired), and failing to complete it will incur miss health penalty but no combo break. Hitting the same colour will not decrement the denden counter, until a different colour is hit instead.

It does not increment the combo counter, and does not recover the health bar in any way. Each successful denden hit only gives a static 300 score, and denden completion will give a perfect(GREAT) large note score.

#### Controls <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

The default controls for osu!taiko are:

| Type | Mouse | Keyboard | TaTaCon |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Red | Left click(L) | `X`(L) / `C`(R) | Flat surface of the drum |
| Blue | Right click(L) | `Z`(L) / `V`(R) | Outer surface of the drum |

The placement of in-game cursor does not matter when playing.

If [Relax](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) mod was used, the score judgement only account for hit timing only (automatically rectify wrong colour hit with correct colour).

*TaTaCon* drum controller were primarily made for the home ports of *Taiko no Tatsujin* and *Taiko: Drum Master*.

### What is osu!catch? <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

*Full explanation: [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch)*

![osu!catch Interface](/wiki/shared/Interface_ctb.jpg "In-game interface of osu!catch")

osu!catch (formerly known as *Catch the Beat*) is the second game mode added to osu!, after the osu!taiko game mode.

Instead of tapping circles to the beat, move the catcher at the bottom of the screen while the fruits fall from above.

#### Basic explanation <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

##### Playfield <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![osu!catch playfield difference between CS2 and CS7](/wiki/shared/Catch_Playfield_27.jpg "osu!catch playfield difference based on CS")

The zoom size of the playfield is based on CS (Circle Size) settings, with lower CS means much more zoomed in and smaller space, while higher CS means much more zoomed out and larger movement space.

The catcher can move from left to right, with the fruits falling from top to bottom. The catcher cannot move pass the left and right walls of the playfield.

All fruits will stay at the plate until its combo ends, which the fruits will bounce out of the plate. Timing and where it falls on the plate does not matter; either a full score for successful catch or miss.

##### Fruits <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Fruits](/wiki/shared/Catch_fruits.jpg "osu!catch fruits")

To catch these fruits, make sure it falls to the plate and not over the plate. Collected fruits will always give 300 points each, increment combo by 1, and treated as 300 in result screen.

##### Fruit trails <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Fruit trails](/wiki/shared/Catch_trails.jpg "osu!catch fruit trails")

A typical fruit trail will contains two fruits (start and end), droplets (slider path), juice drop (slider ticks), and more fruits for each reverse arrow points along with a reversed slider path. Droplet gives 10 points each and treated as 50 in result screen. Juice drop gives 30 points each, increment combo by 1, and treated as 100 in result screen.

Missing the juice drop will break the combo (as it is a slider tick), but missing the droplet will not break the combo. However, missed droplets will not be shown in the local result screen, but will be shown in the website's leaderboard as *Miss Droplet*, which notably affects accuracy (missed out the droplet, which is a 50) and score (10 points for each droplet missed).

##### Bananas <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Bananas](/wiki/shared/Catch_bananas.jpg "osu!catch bananas")

Here, large bananas will rain down and shrink down to catch size as it falls down to the plate (or not). Each collected bananas will give a static score of 1,100 regardless of mod and combo multiplier.

The bananas can be ignored with no health penalty. However, it can cost the extra points and health recovery from collecting the bananas. Notably, [Auto](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) mod will go above and beyond to catch *all* of the bananas without fail.

##### Hyperfruits <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Hyperfruits, and catcher hyperdashing from collecting previous hyperfruit](/wiki/shared/Catch_hyperfruits.jpg "osu!catch hyperfruits")

Hyperfruits are special fruits that will appear to help the catcher to catch the next fruit when normal dash is considered impossible to catch it in a strict timespan allocated. All hyperfruits have a signature red colour surrounding the hyperfruit itself by default.

Collecting the hyperfruit will make the catcher's dash upgraded to *hyperdash* (just fast enough to catch the next fruit), glows red, and leaves a temporary red *afterimage* at the collection point, until the next one fruit was caught or dropped, which the catcher will then be back to normal.

#### Controlling the catcher <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

- By default, the left `<-`(L) and right `->`(R) arrow keys to move the catcher.
- Press and hold the `leftShift`(D) key with one of the arrow keys will make the catcher *dash* in that direction at x2.0 speed (indicated with a **bright glow** from the catcher).
  - Alternatively, press and hold the Left Click(D) button on the mouse to trigger the dash.

The placement of in-game cursor does not matter when playing normally. If [Relax](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) mod was enabled, the control of the catcher will be the in-game cursor instead. However, the play unrankable when Relax mod was enabled (as it defeats the only challenge of osu!catch; fixed catcher speed and catcher plate control).

### What is osu!mania? <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

*Full explanation: [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania)*

![osu!mania Interface](/wiki/shared/Interface_mania.jpg "In-game interface of osu!mania")

osu!mania is the third game mode added to osu!, after osu!taiko and osu!catch game modes.

The mode has been widely used in almost all of the major rhythm games. It require good hand and/or leg coordination where the notes (with their quantity depending on BPM and difficulty) move on a conveyer. The player will have to press the correct key for that specific note in time. Though the game mode was originally made as an imitation of the *Beatmania* style of playing, osu!mania allows changing the number of keys or vertically flipping the orientation of the playfield (this means that it can be made to look more like *Guitar Hero* \[5 keys\] or *Dance Dance Revolution* \[4 keys\] and so on).

When converting a non-specific beatmap, the default key range would be around 4 to 7 keys.

With the [xK](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) game modifier, the player can manually set the number of keys from 1 to a total of 9 keys with a score multiplier reduction. However, the game modifier will not work with osu!mania-specific beatmaps.

With the [Co-Op](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) game modifier, the stage will be split in two, use Co-Op's control scheme, and will allows the player to play from 2 to a total of 18 keys with a score multiplier reduction. Do note that while the preset number of keys will not be doubled on osu!mania-specific beatmaps, it will split the stage in two (left stage priority if odd-numbered), use Co-Op's control scheme, and no score multiplier reduction.

#### Basic explanation <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

##### Playfield <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![osu!mania playfield](/wiki/shared/Mania_playfield.jpg "In-game playfield interface of osu!mania")

By default, the flow of the notes falls from top to bottom of the conveyor (the starting arrow will show where notes will flow to), with the key control at the bottom and the judgement line above the key control. To change the flow of the playfield from bottom-to-top instead, it can be changed in the `Options` sidebar; click on `osu!mania layout` button to set osu!mania keys settings and enable `Vertically flip playfield (DDR style)` for this key setting manually.

Health bar is located at the right side of the conveyor belt. Please note that health drain is disabled in osu!mania, so only the hit objects will affect the health bar. Combo will not break when playing the keys on empty judgement line.

**Scrolling speed of the beat notes** can be changed by pressing `Ctrl` (or `Shift`) with `+` (faster) / `-` (slower) or just `F3` (faster) / `F4` (slower).

##### Notes <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![osu!mania's notes](/wiki/shared/Mania_notes.jpg "osu!mania notes")

Notes are the hit circles of osu!mania. The falling notes must be tapped on the judgement line, with correct key corresponding to each of the note it falls to. More keys corresponding to the falling notes must be tapped simultaneously if the notes fall simultaneously. A score burst will be given when tapped a correct key corresponding to the note in the judgement line.

##### Hold notes <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![osu!mania's hold notes](/wiki/shared/Mania_holdnotes.jpg "osu!mania hold notes")

Hold notes are the sliders and spinners of osu!mania. When the hold note reaches the judgement line, tap the starting note in time with correct key, hold, and release it at the ending note of the hold note.

Health bar regeneration occurs slowly while holding the hold note(s). Depending on the song and mapping quirks, it is possible that other notes or hold notes to appear while holding the previous hold note(s).

#### Controls <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

![Default Key layouts of osu!mania (Options->Input)](/wiki/shared/Mania_key_layouts.jpg "osu!mania key layout")

There two different binding-styles, *Symmetrical* and *Left to Right*.

- *Symmetrical* style mimics the button placement of *DJMAX*, in which the center key is `Spacebar` to simulate a feeling of stepping the pedal similar to the arcade version.
  - Centre key matches the middle column (odd numbered keys only) and the other column matches the keys in its corresponding place.
- *Left to Right* style mimics the button placement of *Beatmania IIDX*, where the first column matches to the *key1*, then the second column matches the *key2* and so on.

*Symmetrical* key binding (For *DJMAX* style)

- For *left* hand buttons — (K1)`A`, (K2)`S`, (K3)`D`, (K4)`F`

#### All <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false-->

**Special grades:**

- Silver SS (SSH) = Normal grade SS with *[Hidden](/wiki/Game_Modifiers)* and/or *[Flashlight](/wiki/Game_Modifiers)* mod.
- Silver S (SH) = Normal grade S with *[Hidden](/wiki/Game_Modifiers)* and/or *[Flashlight](/wiki/Game_Modifiers)* mod.

**Regarding the *Ranks* in profile page:**

- Grades obtained will be set at the profile page under General->Ranks provided the in-game osu!account was still connected online with Bancho server when receiving the grade.
  - **Offline play**, even with osu!account logged-in, **will not be counted**.
- **Grades given for profile depends on ranked/approved top score grade for a beatmap's difficulty in that game mode, not as whole.**
  - If a beatmap has three(3) ranked difficulties, and SS'ed all three of them in osu!catch; three(3) SS will be given for osu!catch's Ranks section, not just one(1) SS given.
  - However, if a new highscore (from better spinner bonus or game modifiers) was achieved from replaying an SS'ed ranked difficulty but was an S grade, then the SS counter will decrement by one(1) and S counter increment by one(1) instead.

## Performance Points

*Full explanation: [Performance Points](/wiki/Performance_Points)*

Performance points(pp) is a ranking metric aiming to be more contextually relevant to a continuous game like osu!. It aims to shift the focus from being on the amount of time played to the actual skill of the player. Performance points is heavily based on map difficulty, determined by a unique algorithm in every game mode. Based on this difficulty alone, each of the scores will be rated and assigned a pp value. Performance rank is predominantly based on performance on individual maps. The easiest way to improve it is to score high on difficult songs, and playing more songs. Do note that game modes are counted separately; playing osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania will raise the pp for the respective game mode.

For any questions regarding pp, please refer to the [wiki page for pp first](/wiki/Performance_Points).

## Common issues and questions

### General

#### Where can I get new beatmaps? <!-- Beatmapping -->

**The Beatmap Listing is a great place to start!**

*See also: [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps)*

To get there and download new beatmaps, go to [`beatmaps`](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) on the Home page. Just remember that you need to sign in in order to download beatmaps.

#### Can I disable Kiai Time? <!-- Beatmapping -->

**No.**

You cannot disabled Kiai Time. This is because, unlike video, it's a feature integrated into the game (as a part with the [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_objects)), and thus cannot be disabled.

#### The maps are too hard! Where can I find some easier maps? <!-- Beatmapping -->

**Some very kind community members have compiled sets of beatmaps for beginners for each game mode.**

For osu!, [Pokebis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8012) has compiled a set of beatmaps suitable for beginners to play. It can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/5456).

For osu!taiko, [OnosakiHito](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/290128) has compiled a set of beatmaps for beginners to learn osu!taiko. It can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/175867).

For osu!catch, [-KevinChan-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/564334) (formerly known as "Kingkevin30") has compiled a nice list of osu!catch beatmaps and basic explanation about osu!catch. It can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/131067).

For osu!mania, [Entozer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/277044) and [Drace](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/818340) (formerly known as "xxidraceixx") have compiled a decent list, sorted by relative player's difficulties, to provide experienced gameplay insight for beginners starting out in osu!mania. Their respective guides can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/147552), and [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/146615).

Alternatively, the website's beatmap search bar has a feature to [sort the ranked beatmap list by difficulty][sort beatmaplist difficulty]. The easiest maps are at the top of the list.

Lastly, [Rivenation](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2063554) (formerly known as "GeKKooo") did a project for [advanced beatmap searching](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/380485) called [osu!search](http://osusearch.com). Which not only has the same features as the official beatmap searchbar, but also has some neat features to define a specific beatmap requirement! The unofficial beatmap search bar can be found at [this link](http://osusearch.com).

#### Does my Level actually do anything? <!-- idk -->

**Level does absolutely nothing**

There's absolutely no difference in any way when comparing a Level 100 player against a Level 1 player, except for the player's own skills and experience of the [game mode](/wiki/Game_Modes) in question. There's no handicap for lower-level players, and nor is there any advantage for the higher-level players (except maybe personal experience).

Level is be based on total score accumulated when online with an account, regardless of pass or fail on the beatmap. You can find the given formula [here](/wiki/Score).

#### Why is my profile stats different ingame? <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false -->

Keep in mind that osu! has four game modes so you might be looking at the wrong game mode.

![Profile_Mode_Buttons](img/Profile_mode_buttons.gif "Profile mode buttons")

#### How do I change the default keyboard key input for my game mode of choice?

*Full explanation: [Options](/wiki/Options)*

**You can change the key inputs in the `Options` sidebar**

![Options sidebar with quickicons](/wiki/shared/Options_quickicons.jpg "Options quickicons")

You change the default keyboard key input from the `Input` section in the `Options` sidebar (as shown above), under the `Keyboard` section (as shown below).

![Options keyboard section](/wiki/shared/Options_keyboard.jpg "Options Input icon, Keyboard section")

#### Game over? Where did I mess up? <!-- Gameplay -->

**To analyze your failed play, you can watch a replay of that play.**

*Full explanation: [Replay](/wiki/Replay)*

After failing a beatmap, you can press the `F1` key to replay the currently failed play. Watching this replay may help you better understand where and why you messed up. 

The replay will end when the screen darkens, with an osu!logo in the middle, rather than the game over screen. To watch the replay again, you can hold the grave/tilde (`` ` ``/`~` respectively) key or `Ctrl`+`R` (by default). You can change this key in the `Options` sidebar inside `Change keyboard bindings` as `Quick Retry (hold briefly)`).

Due to the nature of the fail replay screen, use the `Esc` key to return to Song Selection. Quick retrying the play (as in, the *actual play*) of the beatmap in this state is not possible. It currently works in Solo mode only when given the game over screen. But please keep in-mind that **this replay will not be saved nor allowed to be exported.** To record the failed replay, you'll have to use an external third-party software.

#### Does osu! have keyboard shortcuts? <!-- idk -->

**Yes, absolutely!**

*Full list: [Shortcut key reference](/wiki/Shortcut_key_reference)*

By default, pressing the `Insert` key will hide (or pause if currently playing) and mute osu! into the *Windows* sidebar. To open osu! back up again, you can find the *osu!logo* in the *Windows* sidebar and click on it to return osu!, or you can press the osu! shortcut on the taskbar/desktop. It's called the **Boss key**, and it can be modified in the`Keyboard` section under `Change keyboard bindings`, under `Options`).

Another interesting shortcut is `Alt`+`Enter`. The shortcut toggles the fullscreen mode button in `Options`, but does not work during gameplay or in Multi.

#### What should I backup when installing osu! on a new device?

**The short answer is that you should backup whole `osu!` folder, including hidden files.**

After running `osu!install.exe` and completing the osu! installation successfully, copy the backup `osu!` folder and merge to the new device's `osu!` folder. If it asks for merging `.dll` or `.exe` files, ignore it. Allow merging for everything else, including `.cfg` and `.db` files.

#### Can I use osu! on my mobile device?

**The short answer? Not really. The long answer? Well, read-on!**

*Full list: [Game Modes under External Ports section](/wiki/Game_Modes)*

Currently, osu! does not support any mobile platform.

However, there are other unofficial ports of osu! and a single official spin-off game for iOS which uses their own leaderboard and account system.

Below is a list of a few of the noteable, unofficial osu! ports:

- ![][osu! icon] opsu! \[\Windows/OS X/Linux/Android\]\: Java port of osu! chiefly done by **itdelatrisu** with **fluddokt** providing support for Android version.
- ![][osu!taiko icon] **T-Aiko! v2** \[\Android/iOS\]\ (no longer available): osu!taiko mode ported by **low.moe (Guy-kun) team** with new daily ranked challenge and refined T-Aiko! leaderboard.
- ![][osu! icon] **osu!stream** \[\iOS\]\: Experience the new spin-off of the osu! game mode for the iOS developed by osu! team from grounds up.

However, if you're not a fan of these ports, you can try downloading the [Android and iOS versions of the osu!lazer project](https://github.com/ppy/osu#running-osu)! But keep in-mind that osu!lazer is still an **ongoing work-in-progress.**

#### Why do I not have the max possible combo when I have no misses? <!-- this article is *very lengthy* and also unneeded because a stub will do its job just fine (which i am working on atm), so I won't be changing this very much | cleaned-up: false -->

**A slider was probably released early (meaning that the ball was released before it had finished the ending slider point).**

<!-- *For more information on slider breaks, see: [Slider break](/wiki/Glossary/Slider_break)* -->

![Image showing a slider with slider ticks, with top part during Edit and bottom part during play](/wiki/shared/Sliderticks.png "Image showing a slider with slider ticks, with top part during Edit and bottom part during play")

A slider is composed of a starting circle point, spaced smaller circles known as slider ticks, reverse arrow points (if used, it will be treated as starting circle point instead; it is a proper slider in reverse), and an ending circle point. Each of those points on a slider will add one to the combo. Note that the starting circle point is worth 30 points, the slider ticks are worth 10 points each, the reverse arrow points are worth 30 points each, and the end circle point is worth 300 (or geki), 100 (or katu), or 50 points depending on how the slider was completed.

Slider ticks only appears inside its own slider path; if the slider ticks are too close to the start or end circle as shown in the image above, it will be hidden inside the start or end circle. Hidden slider ticks still counts into combo and score, so it must be collected along with the visible slider ticks. If the slider has one or more reverse arrow points, then the slider ticks will reappear at the same place to be collected in reverse.

If miss the timing to tap the starting circle point, miss the slider ticks, or miss the reverse arrow points, combo will break (it should trigger a combo break sound when the combo is high enough) but it is not considered a miss. However, if miss the ending circle point, combo does not break and does not increment by one. It is also not considered a miss; instead, a 100 (or katu for end of the combo) will be given for the entire slider, assuming at least the slider starting circle point done properly, and completed all the slider ticks/reverse arrow points when given. Notably, [Sudden Death](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) game mod will not trigger its effect of immediate game over when missing the ending circle point (since the combo did not break, the Sudden Death effect was not triggered).

These situations, caused by a slider, are collectively called **sliderbreak**. A max combo play can be known by checking the result screen for the *Perfect* notice on the performance graph; not having the *Perfect* notice, especially without any miss, usually means there is one or more sliderbreak occurred during play.

### osu!taiko <!-- RSF | cleaned-up: false -->

#### What does "Use Taiko skin for Taiko mode" in `Options` under `Skin` section do?

The button only works if a folder named `taiko` (capitalisation does not matter) inside the `Skins` folder of the `osu!` file directory existed.

When enabled, it will use the `taiko` folder's skin elements when playing in osu!taiko, regardless of current skin's taiko elements. If the `taiko` folder was not found, or disabled, it will use the current skin's taiko elements when available; default if all/certain taiko skin element was not found.

**Ancient trivia note:** `taiko` folder used to hold *[Taiko by LuiginHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41319)* skin, which could be downloaded from the now-deprecated `osume.exe` (an osu! updater when osu! need to update) under Skin tab. As the button does not check whether the folder contains elements from *LuigiHann's skin*, it was quickly noted by the community and used as a personal global osu!taiko skin folder.

### Beatmapping

#### "This beatmap you're trying to submit isn't owned by you!"

*For unranked beatmaps only.*

![Example of an .osu file content](/wiki/shared/Beatmap_not_owned.png "Example of an .osu file content")

Please follow these steps:

1. Leave the editor (or close osu!) to make sure the changes apply properly
2. Check the name of the beatmap's folder
   - If it starts with numbers, remove them. Otherwise, osu! will treat it as BeatmapSetID
3. Make sure that the `.mp3` does not start with numbers. Edit the filename in the `.osu` files if it does.
4. Open all the `.osu` files with a text editor (*Notepad* will work)
   - Set your name as creator (and replace it in the file name as well)
   - Set the BeatmapID to 0
   - Set the BeatmapSetID to -1

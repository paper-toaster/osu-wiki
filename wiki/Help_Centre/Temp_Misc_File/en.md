#### Gameplay Basics <!--note for milky (NFM): random shit folder (RSF) | has not been cleaned-up-->

*Tutorial: [osu! tutorial (new beginnings)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1011011)*

The gameplay puts emphasis on:

- Adaptability and reaction to stimuli (that is, the hittable objects appearing all over the screen at lightning speed).
- Understanding of the song's beat and design.
- Input device control.
- Timing of hits on the object that appeared on the screen.
- Ability to spin the mouse (or pen for tablet) on spinners.
- Physical stamina and mental fortitude (especially longer, marathon-type songs).
- Proper positioning and hand-eye coordination.

These are some of the vital skills to become an *osu! rhythm master*. The first step to begin the journey is to learn the basics (and theories) of the hittable objects (referred as *hit objects* from here onwards).

##### Hit circles <!--RSF | cleanup: false-->

![Hit circles](/wiki/shared/osu_hitcircles.jpg "osu! hit circles")

A thin, similarly-coloured approach circle on the outside of the hit circle will shrink over time. Tap on the note at the exact point when it touches the white border of the hit circle. A score burst will appear after tapping the hit circle, showing the score and health changes depending on timing of the tap to the beat. The hit circle will disappear after the score burst.

To understand the hidden charm of hit circles, do not rely on perception only; feel the beatmap's beats and rhythm. It will help in juggling some of the visually-complex hit circles patterns found in later difficulties.

##### Sliders <!--RSF | cleanup: false-->

First, tap on it at the right moment, however, it does not end there. A ball will begin to move across the path. Hold the mouse/keyboard-button (or keep the pen onto the tablet) and follow the ball within the thick orange circle, surrounding the ball, as it moves. The orange outer circle, called the follow circle, will appear if when holding onto the slider's ball, but will disappear when released.

Sometimes, as seen in the screenshot above, the ball may reverse its direction and the player must follow the ball back to the start of the path or vice versa. The visual cue is a reverse arrow at the ending/starting circle of the path.

##### Spinners <!--RSF | cleanup: false-->

![Spinner](/wiki/shared/osu_spinner.jpg "osu! spinner")

Hold on the mouse/keyboard-button (or keep the pen onto the tablet). From there, use the mouse (or pen) and spin the spinner in a circular motion (in either direction) until the spinner circle grows outwards completely. A *Clear* notice will appear to indicate that the spinner was completed. If the spinner was cleared early, continue spinning to collect score bonus and gain some health back.

The outer white circle shows how much time left to complete the spinner. This circle will turn red to notify that time is almost out. Older beatmaps, using *skin version 1.0*, will have a meter/gauge to indicate how close to clearing the spinner.

The small box below the spinner shows spins per minute. The number inside that box translates to the number of spins possible, if to continue to spin the spinner at that speed for one minute. If mouse/keyboard-button was released (or pen did not touch the tablet) early during the spin, the spinner will stop reading the spin.

On the *DS*, this is a good way to scratch the touchscreen (or screen protector), especially on the higher difficulties. In osu!, spinners have been toned down as to not be such a nuisance to complete. The maximum number of spins per minute achievable is 477 which is also the rate at which the [Auto](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) game modifier spins while the [Spun Out](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) game modifier spins slower at 287 spins per minute.

#### In-Game Interface <!--RSF | cleanup: false-->

![osu! interface](/wiki/shared/Interface_osu.jpg "In-game interface of osu!")

The top-left bar is the health bar, which will decrease at a steady rate (depending on the beatmap's difficulty settings), but can be replenished by tapping notes at the right time or spinning the spinner. A perfectly timed hit (a 300 or Geki) will recover health more than a badly timed hit (50). A total miss will take a good chunk of health out of the health bar.

On the right of the health bar is the total score. Below that is the accuracy. The circle beside the accuracy (and below the score) is a timer for the duration of the beatmap. The number on the bottom left is the combo counter/score multiplier.

#### Controls <!--RSF | cleanup: false-->

The default controls for osu! are:

| Mouse | Keyboard | Tablet/Touchscreen |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Left click(M1) / Right click(M2) | `Z`(K1) / `X`(K2) | Touching the screen(M1) |

The hit objects in osu! will accept any input from the input device, as long as each hit objects was tapped in time.

If [Relax](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) game modifer was used, only the in-game cursor will work. Use the in-game cursor to follow the hit objects with automated tap. Spinners must still be completed.

If [Auto Pilot](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) game modifier was used, only the input from the input device will work. Time the tap on the hit objects with automated cursor movement. Spinners will follow the [Spun Out](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) mod speed.
